RFControl raspi installation instructions and additional information

1. run the install.sh script.  

	sudo ./install.sh

	It will:
	a) copy the ftdi driver to /usr/local/lib and update the ld cache
	b) create a "var" directory for files for RFControl and make it rw by everyone
	c) copy a udev rules file to /etc/udev/rules.d so that the USB port is writable by everyone
	d) copy RFControl to /usr/local/bin/RFControl 

2. copy your calibration file to /var/RFControl.  You can find this file on your Windows distribution CD and also in 
   c:/Program Files (x86)/SynthMachine.  If you have a rev4 calibrated board and your serial number is AH009M5T the cal file will be named AH009M5T.csv.  
   If you have a rev5 uncalibrated board it is named caltable.csv

3. each time you plug your RF generator into the raspi or reboot, it will also attach the ftdi_sio driver to it.  This conflicts
   with the driver that is used with RFControl, so you have to unload it. (I don't know how to have the raspi do this by default - maybe a udev rule?) 

	sudo ./scripts/unload_default_drivers.sh
